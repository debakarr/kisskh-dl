```

For more options, use the `--help` flag.

### üìñ Decrypting Subtitles

If you want to decrypt the downloaded subtitles, you need to pass the `--decrypt-subtitle` or `-ds` flag along with a decryption key and initialization vector. Check [#14](https://github.com/debakarr/kisskh-dl/issues/14).

Here is an example of how to pass these parameters from the command line:

```bash
kisskh download "<drama_url>" --decrypt-subtitle --key "your_key_here" --initialization-vector "your_iv_here"
```

You can also set these parameters as environment variables. If you set the `KISSKH_KEY` and `KISSKH_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR` environment variables, they will be used by default.

Here is an example of how to set these environment variables:

- On Linux/Mac:

```bash
export KISSKH_KEY="your_key_here"
export KISSKH_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR="your_iv_here"
```

- On Windows:

```cmd
set KISSKH_KEY="your_key_here"
set KISSKH_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR="your_iv_here"
```

After setting these environment variables, you can use the `--decrypt-subtitle` flag without passing the key and initialization vector explicitly:

```bash
kisskh download "Drama Name" --decrypt-subtitle
```

Please make sure to replace `"your_key_here"` and `"your_iv_here"` with your actual decryption key and initialization vector.

```
